modality:
  value: ''
  definition: The stimulus modality like acoustic, haptic, visual etc.
orientation:
  count: ''
  start: ''
  stop: ''
  definition: The orientation of the bar in degrees.
position_reference:
  alternatives:
  - bottom-right
  - center
  - top-left
  value: ''
  definition: By default stimulus positions are specified by the coordinates of the
    top-left corner (or of the bounding box). Use this property for other definitions.
identifier: ida_mros_stimulus_bars
drifting_velocity:
  value: ''
  definition: In case of a constantly moving bar, the velocity
temporal_offset:
  value: ''
  definition: The temporal offset (with respect to the begin of the recorded trial)
    with which this stimulus was presented.
contrast:
  value: ''
  definition: The contrast of the grating stimulus.
output_channel:
  value: ''
  definition: The physical output device (e.g. an analog output channel, a monitor
    screen, the same loudspeaker, etc.). This information can be used to explicitly
    express that several stimuli (that share the same OutputChannel) are jointly presented.
position:
  value: ''
  definition: The position of the stimulus on e.g the screen. Specified as a 2-tuple
    (x;y). By default this position refers to the top-left corner of the object or
    its bounding box.
intensity:
  value: ''
  definition: The mean intensity of the grating stimulus.
spatial_extent:
  value: ''
  definition: The spatial extend of the presented stimulus (width;height) e.g. (1024;768).
function:
  value: ''
  definition: The function of the described stimulus. E.g. if the white noise constituted
    the carrier.
duration:
  value: ''
  definition: The duration of the stimulus in seconds.
name: ida_mros_stimulus_bars
definition: Properties to describe moving bar stimuli.
