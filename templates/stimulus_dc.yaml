modality:
  value: ''
  definition: The stimulus modality like acoustic, haptic, light etc.
temporal_offset:
  value: ''
  definition: The temporal offset (with respect to the begin of the recorded trial)
    with which this stimulus was presented.
position_reference:
  alternatives:
  - bottom-right
  - center
  - top-left
  value: ''
  definition: By default stimulus positions are specified by the coordinates of the
    top-left corner (or of the bounding box). Use this property for other definitions.
identifier: stimulus_dc
definition: Property definitions to describe a DC stimulus meaning a constant stimulus
  e.g. a constant illumination, current etc.
output_channel:
  value: ''
  definition: "The physical output device (e.g. an analog output channel, a monitor\
    \ screen, the same loudspeaker, etc.). This\n      information can be used to\
    \ explicitely express that several stimuli (that share the same OutputChannel)\
    \ are jointly presented."
position:
  value: ''
  definition: The position of the stimulus on e.g the screen. Specified as a 2-tuple
    (x;y). By default this position refers to the top-left corner of the object or
    its bounding box.
intensity:
  value: ''
  definition: The stimulus intensity in absolute or relative terms.
spatial_extent:
  value: ''
  definition: The spatial extend of the presented stimulus (width;height) e.g. (1024;768).
function:
  value: ''
  definition: The function of the described stimulus. E.g. if the white noise constitutes
    the carrier.
duration:
  value: ''
  definition: The duration of the stimulus in seconds.
name: stimulus_dc
intensity_offset:
  value: ''
  definition: The stimulus intensity given as the offset relative to another stimulus.
