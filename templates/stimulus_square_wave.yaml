amplitude:
  value: ''
  definition: The modulation amplitude (i.e. the difference between up and downstate.)
position_reference:
  alternatives:
  - bottom-right
  - center
  - top-left
  value: ''
  definition: By default stimulus positions are specified by the coordinates of the
    top-left corner (or of the bounding box). Use this property for other definitions.
intensity_offset:
  value: ''
  definition: The mean intensity of the stimulus.
identifier: stimulus_square_wave
duration:
  value: ''
  definition: The duration of the stimulus in seconds.
frequency:
  value: ''
  definition: The frequency of the square wave modulation.
temporal_offset:
  value: ''
  definition: The temporal offset (with respect to the begin of the recorded trial)
    with which this stimulus was presented.
output_channel:
  value: ''
  definition: "The physical output device (e.g. an analog output channel, a monitor\
    \ screen, the same loudspeaker, etc.). This information can be used to explicitely\
    \ express that several stimuli (that share the same OutputChannel) are jointly\t\
    presented."
position:
  value: ''
  definition: The position of the stimulus on e.g the screen. Specified as a 2-tuple
    (x;y). By default this position refers to the top-left corner of the object or
    its bounding box.
spatial_extent:
  value: ''
  definition: The spatial extend of the presented stimulus (width;height) e.g. (1024;768).
function:
  value: ''
  definition: The function of the described stimulus. E.g. if the white noise constituted
    the carrier.
name: stimulus_square_wave
modality:
  value: ''
  definition: The stimulus modality like acoustic, haptic, visual etc.
start_amplitude:
  value: ''
  definition: The amlitude with which the squarewave stimulus started. This may assume
    either intensity offset - or + amplitude/2.
duty_cycle:
  value: ''
  definition: The part of the cylce spend in the up state. E.g. 0.5 if up and down
    state each take half of the time.
definition: A squarewave stimulus was presented. Squarewaves modulate with a certain
  frequency about the intensity offset.
