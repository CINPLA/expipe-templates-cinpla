modality:
  value: ''
  definition: The stimulus modality like acoustic, haptic, light etc.
position_reference:
  alternatives:
  - bottom-right
  - center
  - top-left
  value: ''
  definition: By default stimulus positions are specified by the coordinates of the
    top-left corner (or of the bounding box). Use this property for other definitions.
upper_cutoff_frequency:
  value: ''
  definition: "The upper frequency cutoff of lowpass filter with which the stimulus\
    \ was filtered. (Upper cutoff may also be\n      defined by the nyquist frequency,\
    \ respective the sample rate.)"
identifier: stimulus_white_noise
definition: Property definitions to describe a white noise stimulus.
output_channel:
  value: ''
  definition: "The physical output device (e.g. an analog output channel, a monitor\
    \ screen, the same loudspeaker, etc.). This \n      information can be used to\
    \ explicitely express that several stimuli (that share the same OutputChannel)\
    \ are jointly presented."
mean:
  value: ''
  definition: The mean intensity of the white noise stimulus.
variance:
  value: ''
  definition: The variance of the white noise stimulus.
lower_cutoff_frequency:
  value: ''
  definition: "The low frequency cutoff of the highpass filter with which the stimulus\
    \ was filtered. (Lowest frequency may also be\n      limited by the stimulus duration)"
position:
  value: ''
  definition: The position of the stimulus on e.g the screen. Specified as a 2-tuple
    (x;y). By default this position refers to the top-left corner of the object or
    its bounding box.
spatial_extent:
  value: ''
  definition: The spatial extend of the presented stimulus (width;height) e.g. (1024;768).
function:
  value: ''
  definition: The function of the described stimulus. E.g. if the white noise constituted
    the carrier.
duration:
  value: ''
  definition: The duration of the stimulus in seconds.
name: stimulus_white_noise
filter:
  value: ''
  definition: The filter method applied to limit the frequeny content of the stimulus.
offset_time:
  value: ''
  definition: The temporal offset (with respect to the begin of the recorded trial)
    with which this stimulus was presented.
